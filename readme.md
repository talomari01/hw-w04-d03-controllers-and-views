Today we learned how to organize an Express app using MVC (**M**odel **C**ontroller **V**iews) format. Express has a lot of setup. It can become easy to get lost, especially once we start adding more controllers and models. Constructing everything in an organized way is **key** to keeping track of everything. Lets practice by creating an app from scratch!

## Setup

The only file that has been provided is the data. The rest is up to you to make!

## Completion

Parts 1 - 3.

## Assignment

### Part 1 - Set Up Your App

- `npm init` - Hit enter a bunch of times to accept the defaults
- `npm install express --save` and `npm install mustache-express` --save
- Set up your file structure
    - Make the following directories:
        - `controllers`
        - `models`
        - `public`
        - `views`
    - Create your `index.js` file
- Set up your `index.js` file. Require your packages, set up your app and view engine, and listen on your port. Look back at the planets example we did today as a reference for the syntax.

### Part 2 - Functionality

Below is a description of what your app should contain. Reference the planets lab we did in class to put all the parts together. Figure out your process for constructing your app. Some start with the routes, others start with the model. Do what makes sense to you.

#### Models

You will have 1 model. It will handle the angry bird data. It should include these functions:
- `getAll()` - Will return all of the angry birds.
- `getById(id)` - Will return the angry bird with the inputted id.

#### Views

You should end up with 3 views.
- `index.html` a home page with a link to `/angry-birds`
- `angry-birds.html` This view should have each bird's name, ability, image, and group visible on the page, as well as a link to /angry-birds/BIRDS_ID. There should also be a link back to /.
- `angry-bird.html` This should have the bird's name, ability, image, and group visible on the page, as well as links back to / and /angry-birds


#### Controllers

You will have 1 controller. It will handle all of the `/angry-birds` routes.
- When you go to `/angry-birds/` it should get all of the angry birds from the model and render the `angry-birds.html` view.
- When you go to `/angry-birds/:id` it should get that individual bird from the model and render the `angry-bird.html` view.

### Part 3 - Styling

- Create a `style.css` file in your public directory
- Link the file to your views
- Style your pages! Make it look nice. Aim for this](https://www.lingscars.com/) if you need inspiration.
    - Include any images you want or other elements you want (maybe even some [gifs](https://giphy.com/))
    - Maybe some CSS Hover effects
    - [Gradients](http://www.colorzilla.com/gradient-editor/)? [Animated gradients](https://www.gradient-animator.com/)!?

### Bonus - Filtering

Expand the filtering capabilities of the Angry Birds app

- Look up how to use [query parameters](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#req.query) in express.
- Edit the /angry-birds route to handle query parameters of 'group', 'species', and 'feels'
- Start with testing just one parameter, then increment to exactly two, and then all three
- The page should render an angry bird that matches ALL the criteria of our query parameters - this is not about sorting them into any particular order

### Super Bonus

- Edit the filter function to be able to handle any number of the parameters at a time
- This should not look like a bunch of if conditions regarding the number of parameters, or which combination of parameters are chosen

## Submission
